An Admin Dashboard for a developer site

This is an administrator dashboard for a social-media-esque
Developer site. This project focuses primarily on the HTML
and CSS with a tiny JavaScript file to ensure the search
form is functional. I used grid in 95% of this project, 
with a couple of items using flexbox. This was a challening
project, and I can see the benefits of both layout types
and how they can be used together.
